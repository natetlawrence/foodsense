## Food Sense

The goal of this project is to provide personalized restaurant recommendations to users. Restaurant rating on sites such as Yelp can give an impression of overall quality but since customers have varying taste a single rating number may not provide much insight. To provide personalized recommendations a restaurant similarity index is calculated for a pair of restaurants by finding the group of users who have rated both restaurants and comparing each users recommendation. By averaging these differences a score differential is calculated for each pair of restaurants that have at least 100 overlapping customers.

The data form this project has been scraped from yelp and consits of ~2 million reviews for 7000 restaurants around the bay area. 

To visualize some of this data a taco shop called El Farolito in San Francisco has been chosen. The following shows histograms and scatter plots of the number of common reviews and the score differential for each restaurant in the database.
